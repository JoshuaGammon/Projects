# Projects

This project is a mostly accurate model of Earth's solar system. The planets' elliptical orbits, velocity, orbital inclination, obliquity, and other attributes, are controlled by realtime physics I coded and data from https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_british.html

Please note that this is still a work in progress! This project was my independent initiative to learn Processing, so some aspects of the model are not finished. Most notably, the Sun's lighting, Saturn's rings, and relative sizing of the Sun. I am working to find a creative solution to show the accurate size of the Sun, while still having its planets be visable.

Enjoy!
